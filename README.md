# Semester Project
# This project represents the number of SFPD incident reports from 2018 in 3 different charts. Image Charts API and SFPD's JSON data source were used to create the charts. The incident year was the variable used to count the number of reports. This data is presented in a bar chart and a line chart. I also created a pie chart to represent that information in percentages. These charts are used to compare and keep track of the trend of the reports for every year.
